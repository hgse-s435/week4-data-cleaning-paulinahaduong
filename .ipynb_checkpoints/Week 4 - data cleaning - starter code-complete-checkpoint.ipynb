      "machine-learned mind wandering detector built in one context\n",
      "can be applied to a different (albeit related) interaction context.\n",
      "specifically, the detector was trained on a data set involving\n",
      "participants silently reading and self-reporting mind wandering,\n",
      "but was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated\n",
      "assessments, which engendered different reading strategies.\n",
      "further, self-reports of mind wandering were not collected in this\n",
      "interactive context, which might have influenced mind wandering\n",
      "rates in and of itself. despite these differences, we were able to\n",
      "demonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing\n",
      "that it negatively correlated with both online and offline\n",
      "comprehension scores when evaluated on new participants.\n",
      "second, we showed promising effects for our intervention\n",
      "approach despite a very conservative experimental design, which\n",
      "ensured that the intervention and control groups were equated\n",
      "along all respects, except that the intervention was triggered based\n",
      "on the mind wandering detector (key manipulation). further, we\n",
      "used a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention, because\n",
      "the detector is inherently imperfect. as a result, participants could\n",
      "have received an intervention when they were not mind\n",
      "wandering and/or could have failed to receive one when they were\n",
      "mind wandering. therefore, it was essential to compare the two\n",
      "groups under conditions when the mind wandering levels\n",
      "differed. this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the\n",
      "intervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension\n",
      "(because it is remedial), it equated comprehension scores when\n",
      "mind wandering was high (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",

      "there are a number of methodological limitations with this work\n",
      "that go beyond limitations with the intervention (as discussed\n",
